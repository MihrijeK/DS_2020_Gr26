Cryptography is a method of protecting information and communications through the use of codes so that only those for whom the information is intended can read and process it.
A beale cipher is a modified Book Cipher. Instead of replacing each word in the secret message with a number, you replace each letter in the secret message which  is replaced with a number that represents the position of a word in the book which starts with this letter.
The same number should not be used for the same letter throughout the secret message.
