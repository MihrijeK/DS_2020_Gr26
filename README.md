Cryptography is a method of protecting information and communications through the use of codes so that only those for whom the information is intended can read and process it.
A beale cipher is a modified Book Cipher. Instead of replacing each word in the secret message with a number, you replace each letter in the secret message which  is replaced with a number that represents the position of a word in the book which starts with this letter.
The same number should not be used for the same letter throughout the secret message.

The Playfair cipher is a digraph substitution cipher.The Playfair cipher uses a 5 by 5 table containing a key word or phrase. To generate the key table, one would first fill in the spaces in the table  with the letters of the keyword (dropping any duplicate letters), then fill the remaining spaces with the rest of the letters of the alphabet in order (usually omitting "J" or "Q" to reduce the alphabet to fit; other versions put both "I" and "J" in the same space).
